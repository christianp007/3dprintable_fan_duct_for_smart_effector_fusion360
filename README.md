# 3dprintable_fan_duct_for_smart_effector_fusion360
 A 3d printable fan duct for the delta smart effector designes in Fusion360

I wasn't happy with the cooling performance of the conventional fan duct on my Smart Effector.<br>
Especially on small parts the air wasn't coming close enough th to nozzle tip to effectivly cool the part, additionally the cooling effect was different on all sides of the model.

Design goals:<br>
airflow as close as possible at the nozzle<br>
equal cooling on all sides<br>
simple mounting, if possible single part design<br>
include 40mm hotend fan adapter for silent operation<br>
It's a single part print without support which attaches magnetically to the screws/nuts on the extra mounting holes on the smart effecor. So these can still be used for mounting i.e. a zesty nimble (like on my printer) and the assembly can be taken off within seconds.<br>
For part cooling i'm using a blower fan because high pressure is needed which axial fans do lack, i used a 50mm one but 40mm might work, too (couldn't find one locally which was specified for 24V)<br>

This totally CAN be printed using PLA, but make sure to use a silicon sock and enable the part cooling fan at all times or it will eventually melt away :-D<br>
For PLA i recommend to anneal it. This can be done while mounted, just increase the temperature slowly from 45 to 120 degrees over about an hour with a very low setting of the part cooling fan and then keep it there for another hour.<br>
I successfully printed Nylon at 260 degrees using this printed in PLA.<br>
However PLA will not withstand the temperature forever, so be prepared to replace it or use higher temperature matierials like ABS or Nylon.<br>
I already printed one in Nylon but haven't tested it yet.<br>

There is about 1mm of clearance left between the bottom of the fan duct and the printed part.<br>
However over time the small "finger" slowly droop down due to the heat radiated by the nozzle. Maybe it would be better to have all the "fingers" connected (?)<br>
I used it for dozends of hours before I had to replace it as the air channels slowly closed due to the PLA melting.<br>

It's a work in progress, and I'm happy to get your feedback :-)

Weight ist only about 13g using PLA.<br>
I designed it for printing with my 0.25mm nozzle, so wall thickness is usually 0.6mm.<br>
Should be printable with a 0.4mm nozzle as single walls however.<br>
Layer height: 0.15mm<br>
I added a sacrificial bridge where the nozzle will go.<br>

Magnets used are: dia 5mm, length 8mm but you can use smaller ones and glue them in.<br>
Blower: dia 50mm, width 15mm<br>
Hotend fan: 40x10mm
